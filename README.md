# Load-Forecasting

The project you've described focuses on forecasting the natural demand (nat_demand) using machine learning models. Here's an overview of the project:

Objective: The main objective of the project is to predict the natural demand based on various features such as datetime, weather parameters (temperature, humidity, etc.), holidays, and other relevant factors.

Data Collection: The project starts with collecting historical data on natural demand and related features. This dataset serves as the basis for training and testing machine learning models.

Data Preprocessing: Before training the models, the collected data undergoes preprocessing steps such as:

Handling missing values
Feature engineering: Extracting useful features from raw data
Scaling numerical features: Ensuring all features are on a similar scale
Encoding categorical features: Converting categorical variables into numerical format for model training

Model Training:
The project involves training multiple machine learning models for forecasting nat_demand. Commonly used models include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), LSTM, and GRU.
For LSTM and GRU models, custom classes (TabularLSTMModel and TabularGRUModel) are defined to encapsulate the model architecture and training process.
The models are trained on the preprocessed dataset using historical data.

Model Evaluation:
After training, the models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
The performance of each model is assessed to determine its effectiveness in predicting nat_demand.

Deployment:
The trained models are deployed using a web-based interface built with Streamlit. Users can interact with the deployed application to input new data (e.g., datetime, weather parameters) and obtain predictions for nat_demand.
Streamlit widgets are used to create input fields for users to enter data, and the predicted values are displayed on the interface.

Continuous Improvement:
The project may involve periodic updates and improvements to the models based on new data or changes in requirements.
Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and model ensembling may be employed to enhance the performance of the models over time.

Overall, the project aims to provide accurate forecasts of nat_demand, which can be valuable for planning and decision-making in various domains such as energy management, supply chain management, and resource allocation.
